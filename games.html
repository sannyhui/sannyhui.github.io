                <p>Language: Japanese</p>
                <p>Comment: This game adds the action game element into a RPG game when Japanese RPG games were turn base only at that time. Players have to solve quests and kill monsters in real time which requires certain controlling skill to complete. Not to mention that some puzzle must be solved using special item in specific place. I admit that this game is a legend.</p>

                <p>Comment: It is the first D&D game that I played in my life. I tried to play this game but a lot of English I didn't undrestand which motivated me to search the meaning in the dictiionary. The quest isn't that hard but the difficulty of the game is relatively high. If the party setup isn't good, the game will be harder to complete. </p>

                <p>Language: Japanese</p>
                <p>Comment: An action RPG which requires 3 characters in a team. Players have to control one of them and other 2 characters automatically attack monsters based on the combat tactics. The game story is excellent. But the most attractive thing is the music. I feel sad each time when I heard it's theme music. It's a news that the game was remade and can be played on mobile or PC.</p>

                <p>Comment: An action RPG doesn't require to solve any puzzle. Just keep killing and loot better gears in the dungeon. Since ability of gears are random, players have to kill monsters repeatly to get the best loot. Some players are addicted because of this game and it affect the future development of smiliar games.</p>

                <p>Comment: Event though it's a turn based game. But the game contains 14 playabe characters. Each character have their specialist, unique abilities, personality and backstory. It is a game that full of said stories which easy to emote players. I highly recommend to play this game because of it's content and music. Square Enix really did a great job at that time. But now, hmmm.....</p>

                <p>Language: English</p>
                <p>This game is an excellent D&D action RPG game. Player must form a party to solve the quest. Since it follows the D&D rule, player can be a good or evil character and your teammates also classified with the fame system. It's interesting when a good and evil characters in a same party, one of them may leave randomly. And your actions may affect your fame. NPCs may have different response based on your fame. Not to mention it's really easy to die in the game. So.... save your progress before move to a new map, even it's a town.</p>
