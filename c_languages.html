                <p>My comment: This is the first OOP computer language that I have studied recently. It uses XML to construct the UI and  uses a lot of API to manipulate those objects. It inspired me that how to construct the graphic inferface and the differnt apprach for developing the app like MVC, MVVM, PVC, etc. </p>

                <p>Usage: General programming and Android development</p>
                <p>My comment: When I learned Java last year, I was surpised that why it contains a lot of dummy code comparing to Kotlin. Then I realized that it is an old computer lanuguage and many developers are stilling using it. As a modern computer language, it's really difficult to use especially it doesn't have null safe control. But it is necessary to learn because of it's the second popular computer language in the world.</p>

                <h3>Swift</h3>
                <p>Usage: IOS development</p>
                <p>My comment: It has a very fruitful of API to use. It's IDE is very user friendly. But it's still difficult to learn. Not to mention that it splits into two different braches: SwiftUI and Storyboard. Developers have to spend a lot of time to study if they want to manage both of them. Of course SwiftUI is the main stream for the future. But a lot of applications were written using Storyboard. For me, of course I must master both of them eventually.</p>

                <p>My comment: It's a structural programming language. I learned it when I studied CS50 course this year. It's a classic programming language like Java. But the most spectaular thing is the pointer which made me headache until now. It isn't easy to manage memory as a developer since most modern computer language already automated this process. And I realized that I had done something similar when I was young.</p>

Such as data analysis, AI, machine learning, networking, security, web design, etc.... A one for all computer language that everyone love to use.</p>

                <p>My comment: I don't think any developer loves this programming language. It's the lowest level of computer language that human can understand. And it's no reason to learn it since developers can do the same thing with Java or C language. But why I learn it? The reason is simple. It's the first computer language that I have learnt in my life. I want to know more about the fundamental of computer programming even though I don't think I'll use it to develop ANYTHING.</p>

                <p>My comment: Learning Flutter, a Decrative programming language was a challenge for me. As similiar as SwiftUI, each function (or called Widget) worked as an object on the mobile screen and programmer had to provide enough parameters to make it work. I spent some time to understand how it works and what the necessary item is. But when I got used of it, the development time became faster. It's a very nice tools for mobile development. </p>
