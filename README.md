# My introduction page

### This is the introduction web page of my Github account which was created using Bootstrap. Moreover, the web page “Course Finder” was added which was written with JavaScript. This additional page was dedicated to my sweet classmates who were planning to take their desired Bachelor course. I hope they can achieve their career goal by getting better qualifications.
